# Plan to Investigate the Data Set
1. Researching the data set
2. Use Python to investigate the mean, minimum, maximum and standard deviation of the data set and analyse the results.
3. Graphically represent the data set analysis using python.

# Introduction
Sir Ronald Fisher was a British statistican and biologist who investigated three species of Iris flower and published the results of his investigation in his paper "The use of multiple measurements in taxonomic problems" in 1936.
Fisher was a biologist who pioneered the application of statistics to the design of scientific experiments.
The data set contains 150 observations of the Iris flower. 
Three types of the Iris flower were analysed - Iris setosa, Iris Versicolor and Iris Virginica. 
Measurements were taken of the sepal length, sepal width, petal length and petal width of each of the three species of the Iris flower. The data was recorded in centimetres.
50 flowers of each species were analysed under those four catagories. This led to the data set appearing in the following manner - five columns of data (sepal length, sepal width, petal length, petal width and species) with 150 rows of the data. 
Two of the three species were collected from the Gasp√© Peninsula, Quebec, Canada and it is noted that these species of the Iris flower were collected from "the same pasture, picked on the same day, measured at the same time and by the same person".
