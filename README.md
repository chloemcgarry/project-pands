# Introduction

Ronald Fisher was a British statistican and biologist who investigated three species of Iris flower and published the results of his investigation in his paper "The use of multiple measurements in taxonomic problems" in 1936.
The data set contains data on the sepal length, sepal width, petal length and petal width of three species of the Iris flower - the setosa, the versicolor and the virginica species. 
50 flowers of each species were analysed under those four catagories.
